      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mPage: David Cameron\n",
      "Summary: David William Donald Cameron, Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton,  (born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016, Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and Leader of the Opposition from 2005 to 2010, while he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016. He served as Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from November 2023 to July 2024. Cameron identifies as a one-nation conservative and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies.\n",
      "Born in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at Eton College and Brasenose College, Oxford. After becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition Shadow Cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, and succeeded Howard in 2005. Following the 2010 general election, negotiations led to Cameron becoming prime minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis, which his government sought to address through austerity measures. His administration passed the Health and Social Care Act and the Welfare Reform Act, which introduced large-scale changes to healthcare and welfare. It also enforced stricter immigration policies, introduced reforms to education and oversaw the 2012 London Olympics. Cameron's administration also privatised Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage in the UK. Internationally, Cameron's government intervened militarily in the First Libyan Civil War and authorised the bombing of the Islamic State. Domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as prime minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, Cameron introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the European Union in 2016, during which he supported the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. Following the success of the Leave vote, Cameron resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Theresa May, his home secretary.\n",
      "Although no longer serving as prime minister, Cameron originally stated that he would continue inside Parliament, on the Conservative backbenches. On 12 September, however, he announced that he was resigning his seat with immediate effect, and was succeeded as MP for Witney by fellow Conservative Robert Courts. Cameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as prime minister and the subsequent Brexit negotiations, saying he did not want to be a distraction to May's premiership. He served as the president of Alzheimer's Research UK from 2017 to 2023, and was implicated in the Greensill scandal. Cameron released his autobiography, For the Record, in 2019, which gives inside explanations of the decisions taken by his government. In 2023, Cameron returned to frontline politics after being appointed foreign secretary by prime minister Rishi Sunak and given a life peerage, created Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton. His tenure as foreign secretary was dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel–Hamas war, and the Gaza–Israel conflict and humanitarian crisis. After the Conservatives lost the 2024 general election in a landslide to the opposition Labour Party led by Keir Starmer, Cameron was succeeded by David Lammy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cameron has been credited for helping to modernise the Conservative Party and for reducing the United Kingdom's inherited national deficit as prime minister. However, he was subject to criticism for the 2015 manifesto commitment to implement the referendum on the UK's continued membership of the EU and his vocal support for remain, which ultimately led to his resignation as prime minister.

Ceramic coating \\nis a solution to such problems as they provide good thermal barrier properties \\nfor de signers.

No \\nsingle coating composition appears able to satisfy these multifunctional \\nrequirements. As a result, a coating system is being used . Researchers have \\nled to a preferred coating system consisting of three separate layers to achieve \\nlong term effectiveness in the high temperature, oxidative and corrosive use \\nenvironment for which they are intended to function.  \\n \\nFirst, a thermally pro tective TBC layer with a low thermal conductivity is \\nrequired as the outer layer to maximize the thermal drop across the thickness \\nof the coating. This layer is also called the top coat. This coating is likely to \\nhave a thermal expansion coefficient that d iffers from the component to \\nwhich it is applied. This layer should therefore have a high in -plane \\ncompliance to accommodate the thermal expansion mismatch between the \\nTBC and the underlying nickel super alloy component. In addition, it must be \\nable to ret ain this property and its low thermal conductivity during prolonged \\nenvironmental exposure. A porous, columnar, 100 -200 µm thick, yttria \\nstabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer is currently preferred for this function.  \\n \\nSecond, an oxidation and hot corrosion resist ant layer is required to protect \\nthe underlying turbine blade from environmental degradation. This layer is \\nrequired to remain relatively stress free and stable during long term exposure \\nand remain adherent to the substrate to avoid premature failure of th e TBC \\nsystem. It is important that it also provide an adherent surface for the TBC \\ntop coat. Either low pressure plasma spray (LPPS) or pack cementations are \\nused to apply the bond coat.'),\n",
